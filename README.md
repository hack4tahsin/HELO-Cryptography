## Abstract
Security has been a burning issue for IoT devices recently and cryptographic vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, manipulation of device functionality as well as compromising the security and privacy of both the devices and their users. Also, it becomes a more sensitive matter where nobody wants to negotiate a little about security when it comes to money transactions. To solve this issue, we present an innovative solution with a cryptographic system which is called SHE Cryptography. This stands for Secure Hybrid Encryption. This system is hybridized and gives strong protection against several crucial cryptographic cyberattacks. However, our main objective is to maximize the security level of IoT devices without reducing their performance. It also makes the system ideal for resource-constrained devices because of its lightweight mechanism which ensures faster P2P money transactions. Lastly, our approach offers top-level cryptographic security for IoT devices by ensuring integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of data in terms of secure development of the FinTech industry.

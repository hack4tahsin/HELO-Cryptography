## Abstract

Security in IoT devices has become increasingly problematic, especially due to cryptographic weaknesses that can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, tampering with device functions, and compromised security and privacy for users and devices alike. The challenge of encrypting and decrypting data, and transmitting it over insecure networks, is exacerbated by the limited computational power of IoT devices, particularly when handling large data sets. This not only heightens security risks and increases runtime but also degrades performance and consumes more resources. To tackle this problem, a novel cryptographic system known as HELO (Hybrid Encryption Lightweight Optimization) has been introduced. This hybrid system offers robust defense against various critical cryptographic cyberattacks. The main aim of this research is to bolster the security of IoT devices without diminishing their performance. The HELO system, due to its lightweight design, is perfect for devices with limited resources, providing top-notch cryptographic security by ensuring integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality during peer-to-peer data transmission.

## Advantages:

* **Enhanced Security:** Data access is highly secured, making unauthorized access without proper credentials impossible. Also, intruders cannot breach the entire system at once due to its multi-layered security approach. With limited resources can implement robust security measures.

* **Platform Independent:** Our algorithm is platform independent, meaning that it runs smoothly regardless of the hardware specification due to its structure as it uses minimal computational power. 

* **Reduce Power Consumption:** Since the HELO algorithm uses minimal computational resources, it also means that its power cost is also very low, which means that it does not require much power and in the long run when dealing with lots of data, the cumulative cost reduction in power will be reduced significantly. 

* **Prolong Battery Life:** As it uses minimal power, it means that there is not much pressure on the battery or power supply it uses from, hence it also means that in the long run for devices with low battery capacity.

* **Lower Processing Requirements:** As the complexity of the algorithm is simplified compared to other complex algorithms, the processing time is also lower in comparison to those algorithms. 

* **Minimal Memory Use:** The HELO algorithm uses minimal memory which is effective for devices with minimal memory.

* **Faster Execution:** The algorithm executes very fast which means that it is efficient due to its minimal memory usage.

* **Reduce Latency:** Faster execution leads to reduced latency, thus improving the overall performance of IoT devices.

* **Cost Effective:** Due to its nature in reduced power consumption, prolonged battery life, and minimal memory usage, it fuses to give a cost-effective solution for most IoT systems.

# Conclusion

The HELO cryptographic system addresses numerous security issues identified during research by implementing a comprehensive and secure system that ensures there are no vulnerabilities found in many existing models. Our research paper demonstrates a multi-layered security approach that provides detailed data and access control layer security. This helps in ensuring security in the future. This multi-layer security model is able to protect data against several types of breaches and cyberattacks. Hence, to conclude, the HELO algorithm has been proven to be one of the best approaches for data security as lightweight cryptography in IoT devices for authorization, and authentication.

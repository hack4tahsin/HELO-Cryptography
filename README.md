## Abstract

Security has been a burning issue for IoT devices recently and cryptographic vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, manipulation of device functionality as well as compromising the security and privacy of both the devices and their users. Also, it becomes a more sensitive matter where nobody wants to negotiate a little about security when it comes to money transactions. To solve this issue, we present an innovative solution with a cryptographic system which is called SHE Cryptography. This stands for Secure Hybrid Encryption. This system is hybridized and gives strong protection against several crucial cryptographic cyberattacks. However, our main objective is to maximize the security level of IoT devices without reducing their performance. It also makes the system ideal for resource-constrained devices because of its lightweight mechanism which ensures faster P2P money transactions. Lastly, our approach offers top-level cryptographic security for IoT devices by ensuring integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of data in terms of secure development of the FinTech industry.

## Advantages:

* **Enhanced Security:** Data access is highly secured, making unauthorized access without proper credentials impossible. Also, intruders cannot breach the entire system at once due to its multi-layered security approach. With limited resources can implement robust security measures.

* **Platform Independent:** Our algorithm is platform independent, meaning that it runs smoothly regardless of the hardware specification due to its structure as it uses minimal computational power. 

* **Reduce Power Consumption:** Since the SHE algorithm uses minimal computational resources, it also means that its power cost is also very low, which means that it does not require much power and in the long run when dealing with lots of data, the cumulative cost reduction in power will be reduced significantly. 

* **Prolong Battery Life:** As it uses minimal power, it means that there is not much pressure on the battery or power supply it uses from, hence it also means that in the long run for devices with low battery capacity.

* **Lower Processing Requirements:** As the complexity of the algorithm is simplified compared to other complex algorithms, the processing time is also lower in comparison to those algorithms. 

* **Minimal Memory Use:** The SHE algorithm uses minimal memory which is effective for devices with minimal memory.

* **Faster Execution:** The algorithm executes very fast which means that it is efficient due to its minimal memory usage.

* **Reduce Latency:** Faster execution leads to reduced latency, thus improving the overall performance of IoT devices.

* **Cost Effective:** Due to its nature in reduced power consumption, prolonged battery life, and minimal memory usage, it fuses to give a cost-effective solution for most IoT systems.

# Conclusion

The SHE cryptographic system addresses numerous security issues identified during research by implementing a comprehensive and secure system that ensures there are no vulnerabilities found in many existing models. Our research paper demonstrates a multi-layered security approach that provides detailed data and access control layer security. This helps in ensuring security in the future. This multi-layer security model is able to protect data against several types of breaches and cyberattacks. Hence, to conclude, the SHE algorithm has been proven to be one of the best approaches for data security as lightweight cryptography in IoT devices for authorization, authentication, and especially for FinTech.
